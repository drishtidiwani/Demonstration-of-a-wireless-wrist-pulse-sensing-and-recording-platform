# Demonstration-of-a-wireless-wrist-pulse-sensing-and-recording-platform
In this project I have used wireless battery operated ESP32C3 interfaced with 3 MAX30100 pulse sensors via a
I2C multiplexer TCA9548A on PCB which is used for using 3 serial communication devices at the same time. The
pulse sensor uses IR light to detect the pulse and serially communicates with ESP32 to display Vaata (V), Pitta (P), and Kapha (K) waveforms on Arduino IDE platform.
